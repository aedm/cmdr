Translators log English-side problems here while translating: ambiguous or inconsistent English, a weak `@key`
description, a missing screenshot, or a rule every language should follow. One bullet per item, at most two lines: the
key(s), what's wrong, the suggested fix. The lead fixes the English, the description, or the shared docs (promoting a
rule into `translation-principles.md` or `translator-instructions.md`), then deletes the entry; git keeps the history.

## Open

- `fileExplorer.network.browser.removeHostConfirm`, `.hostRemoved`, `.hostRemoveFailed`: descriptions (and key names)
  still say "remove" while the English says "Forget". Say forget, and that the host is a saved server.
- `fileExplorer.network.share.useGuest`: "Use guest" is terse and the description doesn't say whether it reconnects as
  guest or re-lists the shares. Consider "Switch to guest" or "Browse as guest".
- `menu.network.unpin`, `servers.pinHint.body`: the descriptions still call it a "very short label" / quote "Unpin", but
  the English is now "Unpin from switcher". Update both; "switcher" alone doesn't hit the `volume-switcher` concept
  either.
- `servers.paneState.notConnected`: "{name} isn't connected" forces agreement with `{name}` in gendered languages, and
  the description says "yet" where the English doesn't. Prefer "Not connected: {name}"-style framing.
- `servers.hub.shareAccount`, `.guestAccount`: "as {username}" has no bare equivalent in many languages; say a label
  form ("Account: sven") or an added verb is fine, and add a screenshot.
- `fileExplorer.navigation.forgetConfirmButton`: one button serves the server, share, and saved-password alerts; locales
  that clear a password with another verb (zh `清除`) get a button that doesn't match the title. Consider a separate
  key.
- `servers.hub.editPickHint`: "Select a server" pulls locales toward their file-marking verb; the English means moving
  the cursor to a row.
- Cross-language rule proposal: when English prose names a button without quotes (`servers.sheet.addAnywayHelp`,
  `servers.pinHint.body`), a locale may quote it; or quote it in English too.
- `list` concept: matches the verb "lists" (Cmdr lists …); add a verb-sense `notMatch` so locales stop needing
  exceptions.
- `go-back` concept: matches "forward" while its headword is "Go back"; split or rename.
- `fileExplorer.network.share.signIn{Title,Message}`, `fileExplorer.networkMount.signIn{Title,Message}`: the screenshot
  is the servers list, not the calm sign-in screen these strings sit on. Capture that pane (with and without the sheet).
- `fileOperations.transferProgress.stage*` (compress and archive-upload phases, and their `*Step` variants): coupled to
  `transfer-dialog.png`, whose note lists only scanning/paused/queued/finishing. Capture a compress-to-remote run
  showing the "Step 1 of 2" line, and name the compress phases in the note.
- `step` concept: its definition says onboarding, setup guide, or install; widen it to any numbered stage of a
  multi-step operation (the two-step compress-then-upload labels now use it).
- `zip` has no concept, yet it recurs in prose (`errors.write.archiveEntryName*`, `settings.archives.*`). Register it so
  each locale's prose form is ruled (de neuter `Zip`, sv `zip-fil`, hu `zip archívum`, zh-Hant `zip`).
- `errors.write.archiveEntryName*` messages: "some tools", "zip tools", and the verb "share" tripped `ai-tool` and
  `network-share`; `notMatch` entries now cover these, but a sense-aware matcher would stop the next one.
- `servers.hub.nearbyGroup`: no screenshot, and the description doesn't say whether a count-last shape is fine (hu, zh,
  and zh-Hant lead with "found nearby"). Recapture the hub with the group header showing, and say the order is free.
- `errors.write.destinationNotAFolder.message` leaves `{path}` bare while its one-line twin
  `errors.volume.notADirectory` quotes it (“{path}”). If the dialog styles the path itself, say so in the description;
  otherwise quote it in both.
- `pnpm i18n:brief --keys a b c` (space-separated) silently briefs only `a` (header says "1 key"). Reject stray
  positional args, or accept both separators.
- Tooling: `sync-locale-keys.ts --restamp` skips overlays (`es-419`), so a new overlay fork's `sourceHash` (the hash of
  the `es` value it overrides) had to be computed by hand with `sourceHash()` for
  `fileExplorer.pane.openLocalNetworkSettings`. Let `--restamp` (or a `--fork`) stamp overlay keys too.
- `{localNetwork}` keys (`fileExplorer.pane.directConnectionBlockedByThisMacToast`, `.openLocalNetworkSettings`,
  `servers.refusal.localNetworkHint`): no screenshot of the toast or the Add server hint. Capture both so translators
  can judge the button's width and whether the pane name reads better quoted (zh and zh-Hant quote it, the rest don't).
- `volume-switcher` matches only "volume switcher" / "volume chooser", so a bare "switcher"
  (`settings.behavior.serversPinHintSeen.label`, `menu.network.unpin`) shows as "No concept yet". Add `switcher` to its
  `match`, with `app switcher` in `notMatch`.
- `settings.adb.install.intro`, `settings.fileOperations.adbEnabled.description`: the descriptions say to use Google's
  localized name for the platform tools and never keep the English, but Google doesn't localize "SDK Platform Tools" in
  most locales (sv, nl, fr, de checked). Say: keep the English where Google does. Also say whether "choose Re-check"
  means clicking (sv, nl, and es wanted `klicka på` / `klik op` / `haz clic en`). (sv, nl, fr, de)
- Go to folder: Finder pt-BR splits its menu and dialog wording, which `i18n-term-consistency` forbids; the `goToPath.*`
  `@key` notes should say the menu item wins. (pt)
- `errors.eject.unmountRefusedByProcesses`: zh-Hant's list join can run Latin into Han with no space
  (`cfprefsd和其他程序`). (zh-Hant)
- `servers.paneState.unreachable`, the eject-process keys: say in the descriptions which shipped sibling to mirror
  (`servers.refusal.unreachable`, `errors.eject.otherApps`); every locale converged on them anyway. (fr)
- `adb.disconnectBusyTooltip`: "Disconnect" doesn't say whether Cmdr drops the device or the person leaves it, which
  decides transitive vs reflexive in fr. (fr)
- No concept yet for "called", "others", "reach", "usual", "leaving", "android", "adb"; "switcher" is the one that
  matters (zh-Hant has both 卷宗切換器 and a bare 切換器). (de, zh-Hant)
- `fileExplorer.listingStalled.*`, `indexing.overall.*`: no `screenshot`. Capture the stalled-listing pane and the
  checklist with the whole-run line, so locales can judge length and the spinner context. (all)
- `indexing.overall.eta`: `{eta}` can be "Almost done", which arrives capitalized after the colon; several locales then
  read "Total: Almost done". Say in the description whether the inserted phrase is sentence-initial or not. (de, hu, vi)
- `errors.write.insufficientSpace.suggestion`: "may mean it needs less" leaves "it" (the copy) implicit; locales named
  the copy or the space outright. Say "the copy may need less". No screenshot of the dialog with "Copy anyway" either.
  (all)
