 * Every shortcut bound right now, as `commandId → combo`.
 *
 * A native context menu is rebuilt from scratch on every right-click, so it can label
 * its items from this instead of carrying literal strings, which start lying the moment
 * someone rebinds a key in Settings > Shortcuts. A command with nothing bound is left
 * out, and its item then shows no accelerator, which is the honest answer. Rust looks
 * each one up by MENU id (`menu/menu_structure.rs`, `ContextMenuShortcuts`).
 *
 * ❗ The canonical spelling, ❌ never `toDisplayShortcut`: the display glyphs (`⌫`, `⎋`)
 * mean nothing to Rust's accelerator conversion and come out as garbage, and macOS draws
 * the canonical names as glyphs by itself.
 *
 * Built fresh per popup, which is what keeps it true. That's one map lookup per command,
 * against a right-click that already spends a LaunchServices query on "Open with".
 *
 * ❗ It lives HERE rather than inside the `showFileContextMenu` wrapper, which is where
 * it belongs by rights: `shortcuts-store` imports `$lib/tauri-commands` to push menu-bar
 * accelerators, so reading the registry from inside that barrel closes a cycle the
 * `import-cycles` check rejects. The callers pass it instead.
