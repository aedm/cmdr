/**
 * The `operation-conflict` preview: the gallery's one REAL-OPERATION row.
 *
 * `OperationConflictDialog` takes no props and shows whatever clash the main
 * window's conflict host is holding, and only a live operation parked on a real
 * `write-conflict` gives it one: the line naming which transfer is asking, the
 * Cancel / Rollback row, and every answer all read that operation. So the
 * preview starts one. It copies a fixture item onto a same-named entry in the
 * conflict fixture's destination under "Ask for each", through the app's own
 * `dispatchTransferOperation`, and claims no progress dialog, which is exactly
 * the shape of a copy sent to the queue: the host owns the clash and asks.
 *
 * What the reviewer answers really happens, inside the throwaway fixture tree.
 * The next trigger's fixture call puts the destination back (`dev_fixtures.rs`).
