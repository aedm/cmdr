/**
 * The main window's Escape key, and the full-screen exit it may trigger.
 *
 * WKWebView hands every keydown the page leaves unprevented back to AppKit, which
 * turns Escape into `cancelOperation:`, and a full-screen window answers that by
 * leaving full screen. So an Escape that closed a dialog, a menu, or a dropdown
 * would ALSO restore the window unless something prevented its default. Two
 * pieces keep AppKit from ever seeing an Escape from this window:
 *
 * - `installEscapeStopClaims` makes stopping an Escape claim it: a handler that
 *   stops the key has used it, so it must not reach AppKit either. That covers
 *   every local handler (dropdowns, menus, popovers, the rename editor) without
 *   each one having to remember `preventDefault`.
 * - The document dispatcher (`global-keydown.ts`) prevents every Escape that
 *   reaches it, and hands one nothing used to `exitFullScreenOnEscape`.
 *
 * Leaving full screen is then OUR decision, gated on the
 * `advanced.exitFullScreenOnEscape` setting, instead of an accident of which
 * handler forgot `preventDefault`.
