/**
 * Ask Cmdr surface captures for the i18n screenshot-capture driver
 * (`i18n-capture.spec.ts`).
 *
 * Ask Cmdr is the largest single uncoupled area in the catalog, and none of it is
 * reachable from a dialog trigger: the rail is a panel inside the main window
 * whose content depends on Ask Cmdr's switch, on a provider being willing to answer,
 * and on there being threads to list. So this module walks the rail the way
 * `ask-cmdr.spec.ts` does, capturing four states in the order the user meets them:
 *
 *  1. `ask-cmdr-gate-off`: the "Ask Cmdr is off" gate a fresh profile opens to.
 *  2. `ask-cmdr-empty`: switched on, a new chat with no messages yet.
 *  3. `ask-cmdr-chat`: one exchange, so the message chrome, the thinking line, and
 *     the cost footer render.
 *  4. `ask-cmdr-sessions`: the threads panel over a thread that exists.
 *
 * The replies come from the scripted fake LLM, not a real provider: the capture
 * launch sets `CMDR_E2E_ASK_CMDR_FAKE=1`, which is the single source of truth for
 * both `resolve_agent_llm` (which answers) and the composer's provider gate (which
 * allows the send), so the two can't disagree. Without it the composer refuses to
 * send and the chat surface would photograph an empty thread.
 *
 * The gate surface is BEST-EFFORT: the switch lives in `settings.json` and persists
 * for the life of the data dir, so a second capture run against a warm dir opens
 * straight to the composer. It's captured when the gate shows and recorded as a
 * documented skip when it doesn't, rather than faking a screen the user has
 * already passed. The rail's other gate ("Cloud AI is off") needs `ai.provider` on
 * Cloud, which the fake provider never is, so its keys couple by representative
 * rule instead.
