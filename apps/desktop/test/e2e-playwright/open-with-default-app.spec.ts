/**
 * E2E for handing a file to its default app: Enter and ⌘↓ each launch it ONCE.
 *
 * The count is the whole point, and only a real keypress can pin it. Both combos
 * travel two roads at once — the pane's own keydown handler, and the document-level
 * dispatcher that `nav.open` sits in — so a pane handler that forgets to stop the
 * event opens the file twice. That stayed invisible for months, because a second
 * `open` on a `.txt` just re-focuses the TextEdit window already showing it; a
 * Google Drive file is what exposed it, with two browser tabs for one Enter.
 *
 * The `playwright-e2e` build records the request instead of launching anything
 * (`crate::open_mock`), so the spec reads the count back through `e2e_opened_paths`
 * and nothing lands on the desktop.
 *
 * Each test opens a SECOND file and waits for it, which is what makes "exactly one"
 * assertable without a timer: the second keypress crosses the socket as its own
 * task, so anything the first press still had coming has already landed by then.
 *
 * Fixture (at $CMDR_E2E_START_PATH):
 *   left/                   <- left pane starts here
 *     file-a.txt, file-b.txt, sub-dir/, ...
