//! Which attached disk images are stored ON the drive being ejected.
//!
//! An image whose backing `.dmg` lives on the drive keeps that drive busy for as long
//! as it stays attached, and no amount of closing apps frees it: the image itself has
//! to be ejected first. That's its own sentence in a refusal, so it needs its own
//! [`HolderKind::DiskImage`](super::super::HolderKind::DiskImage).
//!
//! **The signal is `hdiutil info -plist`**, whose `hdid-pid` IS the process holding the
//! backing file open, so an image lands on a pid the holder walk already named rather
//! than as an invented one. ❌ Not IOKit's `IOHDIXHDDriveOutKernel` `image-path`
//! property, which names the image but carries no pid, and ❌ not that node's
//! `IOUserClientCreator`, which would mean parsing a sentence. (Verified on macOS 27.0,
//! 2026-09-16: a nested HFS+ image on an outer HFS+ image read `hdid-pid` 12984, which
//! is the pid `lsof` showed holding the outer volume's `inner.dmg`; `hdiutil info
//! -plist` answered in 18 ms.)
//!
//! Whether an image sits on the drive is its backing file's `st_dev` against the target
//! roots' own — ❌ never a path prefix, which a firmlink or a symlinked `/Volumes` entry
//! breaks silently.
