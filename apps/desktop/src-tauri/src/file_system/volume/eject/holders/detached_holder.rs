//! A test holder that runs a binary FROM the drive it holds, and doesn't descend from
//! the test process.
//!
//! Both halves are load-bearing, and neither is obvious:
//!
//! - **Not a descendant.** `facts`'s first rule answers `Cmdr` for anything this process
//!   started, and it beats every rule below it. A plain `Command::spawn` child can
//!   therefore never exercise rule 5, so this one is started through a shell that exits
//!   and leaves it to launchd (verified on macOS 27.0, 2026-09-16: `PPID` 1).
//! - **Running from the drive.** macOS SIGKILLs a plain copy of an arm64e platform binary
//!   (`/bin/sleep` copied and run: exit 137, macOS 27.0, 2026-09-16), so the copy is
//!   re-signed ad-hoc, which is enough to run it and leaves it un-platform.
