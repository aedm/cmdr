//! Who held the drive when an unmount was refused.
//!
//! A refusal that names nobody leaves a person with nothing to do about it, so after
//! the LAST attempt (`run_teardown`) one scan asks the kernel which processes have the
//! drive open, over every mount of the teardown that's still in the table.
//!
//! **The scan is bounded and abandonable.** `proc_listpidspath` `stat`s its path before
//! it walks the process list, and that `stat` took 142 ms to 9.4 s under load and can
//! hang for good on a wedged mount, so the walk runs on ONE plain std thread nobody
//! joins: past [`HOLDER_BUDGET`](super::deadlines::HOLDER_BUDGET) the answer is
//! "couldn't tell" and the thread is left to end on its own. ❌ Never the blocking pool:
//! a wedged scan would hold one of its threads for as long as the mount stays wedged.
//!
//! **A scan that couldn't run names nobody, which is ❌ never "nobody is holding it"**
//! ([`HolderScan`]) — the same three-answers rule as `disk_target::DiskMounts`.
//!
//! **Two stages, one budget.** The walk names each holder by its executable; then
//! [`facts`] says what KIND of holder it is, which is what picks the sentence the refusal
//! reads. Both run on the one abandonable thread, and the facts run SECOND for two
//! reasons: rule 5 needs the device of every mount of the teardown, not just the one
//! being walked, and a budget that runs out mid-facts then leaves every holder named and
//! [`HolderKind::Unclassified`] rather than dropping the ones it never reached.
