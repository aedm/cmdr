//! The kernel walk behind the holder scan: which processes hold a volume, and what to
//! call each one.
//!
//! macOS answers through `libproc`'s `proc_listpidspath`, declared here as two
//! `extern "C"` lines. ❌ No `libproc` crate for two functions. It sees SAME-UID
//! processes only (`CHECK_SAME_USER`, `xnu/bsd/kern/proc_info.c:2196-2211`), catches
//! open files, cwd, and per-thread cwd, and misses a holder that only memory-mapped the
//! file. Root-owned holders stay invisible, which is why a refusal can still name
//! nobody (`volume/DETAILS.md` § "Eject").
//!
//! Anywhere else the answer is `Unreadable`, which reads as "couldn't tell", ❌ never as
//! "nobody is holding it".

/// Linux has no walk to run, so every refusal there is "couldn't tell". It still goes
/// through `scan_path_with`, so the answer has ONE shape whatever the platform, and the
/// `Unreadable` comes from a walk that couldn't run rather than from a second code path.
