//! The two volumes a transfer runs between, captured when it starts, and what an
//! operation says when one of them leaves the mount table mid-flight.
//!
//! A drive that vanishes is gone from the volume list AND from the mount table
//! by the time an error is worded, so nothing can look its name up then. Both
//! sides are therefore captured at START (`transfer::volume::copy` /
//! `::r#move`, where both volumes are already resolved) and carried on the
//! operation's state.
//!
//! ❌ Never work a side out from a path prefix: the transfer is HANDED both
//! volumes, and a prefix match can't tell two mounts of the same tree apart.
//! Paths are used here for one thing only, picking between two sides that have
//! BOTH left.
