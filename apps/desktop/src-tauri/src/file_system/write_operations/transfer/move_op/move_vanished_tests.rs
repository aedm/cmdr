//! What a cross-filesystem move does when a drive leaves mid-flight.
//!
//! Phase 4 is the only place in Cmdr that deletes files the user didn't ask to
//! delete, so every "it's already gone" reading in it is checked against the
//! mount table first. These drive the engine with the table answered by
//! `transfer_sides::test_hook`, so no test needs a real drive.
