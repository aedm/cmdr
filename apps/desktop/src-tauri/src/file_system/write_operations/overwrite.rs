//! How a local write lands: the bytes always go to a `.cmdr-tmp-*` sibling and
//! take the destination's real name by a single same-directory `rename(2)`. When
//! an existing entry is in the way, it is renamed aside first, so the user's
//! original survives every failure up to the swap.
//!
//! **The invariant.** A local destination path must never hold a partial file.
//! Whatever a crash, a force-quit, or an abandoned worker thread leaves behind
//! wears a `.cmdr-tmp-*` name nobody mistakes for their data. Staging is what
//! makes abandoning a worker safe: it is writing to a temp nobody will rename.
//!
//! [`stage_and_land_file`] is the single landing for every local file copy —
//! APFS clone, chunked copy, `copy_file_range`, and the `std::fs::copy`
//! fallback all hand it a closure that puts bytes at a path.
//! [`safe_overwrite_dir`] is its type-agnostic sibling, for a materializer that
//! creates a directory rather than a file.

/// The helper is type-agnostic: `dest` may hold a file or a directory before
/// the call, and `materialize` may create either a file or a directory. The
/// two cmdr-cross-type cases that motivated it:
///
/// - **Folder→file overwrite (copy/move):** source is a directory whose
///   contents will be materialized at `dest`, which currently holds a file.
///   The closure creates a fresh directory and populates it; on success the
///   blocking file is removed via `remove_file`.
/// - **File→folder overwrite (copy/move):** source is a file whose bytes
///   will be materialized at `dest`, which currently holds a directory. The
///   closure writes the file; on success the existing folder is removed via
///   `remove_dir_all`.
///
/// Steps:
/// 1. Sets aside the existing `dest` as `dest.cmdr-temp-{uuid}` via a single
///    `rename(2)`.
/// 2. Runs `materialize(dest)` to land the new content. The closure decides
///    whether `dest` becomes a file or a directory.
/// 3. On `Ok`, removes the aside (`remove_dir_all` for directory asides,
///    `remove_file` for file asides).
/// 4. On `Err`, removes whatever the closure left at `dest` and renames the
///    aside back to `dest`, then propagates the error.
///
/// **Atomicity guarantee:** at every observable moment after this function
/// is called and before it returns, `dest` is either the original
/// (untouched) or the new materialized content. The closure may briefly
/// leave a half-written entry at `dest`, but the original is recoverable
/// from the aside even on a crash — the aside has the recognizable
/// `cmdr-temp-` prefix so a user can restore it by hand.
