//! When a periodic network send is due, for the loops that talk to our servers on a schedule (the
//! analytics heartbeat and the update check).
//!
//! The rule is a throttle, never a debounce: at most one SUCCESSFUL send per `interval`, and a failed
//! send retried no sooner than `retry_floor` after it. A burst of triggers (a relaunch, a wake from
//! sleep) collapses into one send and never pushes the next one further out. The record is persisted
//! by its owner, so a relaunch doesn't reset the clock; the loops wake on a short tick and ask
//! [`SendRecord::due_in`] instead of sleeping a whole interval.
//!
//! Timestamps are wall-clock Unix milliseconds, since they have to survive a relaunch. A clock set
//! backwards could put a stored time in the future; it's read as "now", so the worst case is one
//! interval of waiting rather than a loop that never sends again.
