//! Which directories a search refuses to look inside, however it's reading them.
//!
//! The sibling of [`matcher.rs`](super::matcher): that one owns the per-entry
//! predicates, this one owns the SCOPE exclusions (`excludeDirNames` and the
//! `excludeSystemDirs` tier), and both exist for the same reason — two evaluators
//! ask the same question and must not answer it differently.
//!
//! - the **arena scan** ([`super::engine`]) walks an entry's ancestor ids through
//!   the in-memory index and asks about each ancestor's name, and
//! - a **live walk** has no ids at all, so it asks about the components of the
//!   entry's own path.
//!
//! The rules themselves — what counts as an exact name, what's a glob, what's a
//! path prefix, and how case folding applies to each — live here once. A fork
//! there is silent: the same query would exclude a folder on an indexed drive and
//! search it on an unindexed one.
//!
//! ❌ Case folding isn't derived here either. It arrives from the compiled query
//! (`CompiledQuery::case_insensitive`), so the pattern, the ranker, and these
//! exclusions all fold under one alphabet.
