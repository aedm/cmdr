// under the system allocator it made even a query that matches nothing 30–45% slower
// (`docs/notes/performance/search-loop-allocations-2026-09-27.md`). These pin the
// count per QUERY: the difference between a big arena and a tiny one is what the rows
// cost, and it has to stay far below the row count.

/// Rows in the big arena. Big enough that per-row allocation dwarfs the budget.

/// chunk (seven here, ~30 allocations each), rayon's bookkeeping, and the result
/// `Vec`s, plus the ranking memos and 30 result rows for a full search. ~225 with no
/// match, ~360 with 11,250 matches, and ~625 ranking them against weights when this
/// was written; per-ancestor folding was 316,000 and a path `Vec` per folder 26,000.
///
/// ⚠️ The regex half of the fix (a clone per chunk, `engine.rs`) is NOT reliably
/// pinned here: in a debug build the regex pool's lock is rarely contended, so the
