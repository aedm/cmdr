//! The per-share "Use Cmdr's fast direct connection" switch, as the volume switcher
//! asks about it: by volume id.
//!
//! The choice itself lives in `known_shares` (keyed by server and share, so it
//! outlives any one mount's volume id), and the auto upgrade reads it in
//! `smb_upgrade::register_smb_volume`. This module answers the two questions the UI
//! has, which both start from a volume: what the share behind it is set to, and what
//! flipping it does right now.
