//! The wake loop's IPC surface: the live-apply pushes behind its settings and the Ask Cmdr
//! switch, and the seed read the status corner's indicator starts from.
//!
//! The loop owns its own thread, its own inbox, and a timer parked against a deadline, so a
//! settings change has to REACH it rather than being noticed the next time something happens.
//! The push is a message on the never-dropped control lane; nothing here touches the inbox.
