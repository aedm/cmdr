//! The row boundary rule: where the viewer breaks a file into rows.
//!
//! The viewer renders **rows**, not physical lines. A row ends at a newline or
//! after a segment, whichever comes first, so a file with no newline in it costs
//! a bounded read per fetch instead of the whole file. Nothing is dropped; a long
//! line simply occupies several rows.
//!
//! The rule is defined once, as a **boundary set**, and both `row_start` and
//! `row_end` are derived from it. A byte offset `b` is a row boundary exactly
//! when one of these holds:
//!
//! 1. `b == 0`, or
//! 2. `b` is the start of a physical line (the offset just past a newline), or
//! 3. `b` is a multiple of [`SEGMENT_BYTES`] **below EOF** **and the window
//!    `[b - SEGMENT_BYTES, b)` contains no newline**, snapped back to the nearest
//!    character start.
//!
//! Then `row_start(offset)` is the greatest boundary `<= offset`, and
//! `row_end(row_start)` is the least boundary `> row_start`, or EOF.
//!
//! ❗ **"Below EOF" in clause 3 is load-bearing.** A multiple sitting exactly on EOF
//! cannot start a row, because nothing follows it. Admitting it looks harmless and is,
//! until the file ALSO ends mid-character: the snap then drags it back below EOF and
//! invents a boundary, splitting a couple of truncated bytes off as their own row. The
//! same byte then belongs to two rows depending on which direction you read the rule
//! from, which is invariant I4.
//!
//! ❗ **Clause 3's second half is the whole design, not an optimization.** A
//! `SEGMENT_BYTES`-wide window with no newline implies a line at least that long.
//! Contrapositive: if every line is shorter than `SEGMENT_BYTES`, no multiple ever
//! qualifies, no row ever ends anywhere but at a newline, and rows are exactly
//! lines. Drop the window test and every ordinary file gains a spurious break
//! every 20 000 bytes, because a line straddling a multiple gets cut. (A line of
//! EXACTLY `SEGMENT_BYTES` is not shorter than one, so it does split: into a full
//! row plus a row holding only its newline.)
//!
//! ❌ **Do not derive `row_end` as `row_start + SEGMENT_BYTES`.** It reads like the
//! same thing and is not: after a newline at byte 100, iterating gives a row
//! `[101, 20101)` while probing at 20050 gives `row_start = 20000`, so the same
//! byte belongs to two different rows and a byte-offset seek re-renders overlapping
//! text. Both ends come from the boundary set, always.
//!
//! **Boundaries are absolute file offsets, BOM or no BOM.** `full_load.rs` scans
//! BOM-stripped indices; anchoring rows to those would put FullLoad's rows out of
//! step with ByteSeek's across a reload or a tail escalation, which swap backends
//! under a live frontend row cache.
//!
//! The forward walk over this boundary set, and the row types a fetch hands back,
//! live in `row_walk.rs`. This file is the rule; that one reads it.
//!
//! Architecture and the invariants (I1-I6): `DETAILS.md` § "Rows, not lines".
