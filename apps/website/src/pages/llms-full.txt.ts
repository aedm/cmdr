> The fastest two-pane file manager for macOS. Every folder sized. Every file found.

Cmdr is an extremely fast, keyboard-driven, two-pane file manager for macOS (Linux in alpha), built with Rust, Tauri 2, and Svelte 5. It indexes your entire drive in minutes, shows directory sizes everywhere, and offers instant search and keyboard-driven everything. AI features (smart search, natural language rename, batch operations) are in active development. Free for personal use, source-available under BSL 1.1.

## Features

### Core features

- **Live full-disk index**: Indexes your entire drive once in about 4 minutes. Then stays current forever, even across restarts. Shows precise, up-to-date folder sizes. Instant search.
- **Blazing fast**: Built in Rust. Opens a 100k-file folder in 4 seconds with icons, sizes, and dates. Startup is near-instant.
- **Keyboard-first**: Navigate, select, copy, move without touching your mouse. Two panes, tabs, command palette. Every action has a keyboard shortcut, and you can customize them all.

### AI features (in active development)

- **Smart search** (rough around the edges): Find files by describing them in plain English: "that PDF contract from last month" or "screenshots with error messages." No need to remember exact file names.
- **Natural language rename** (coming soon): Type "make these lowercase and add date prefix" and watch it happen. No regex, no scripts, just words. Cmdr understands your intent and renames files accordingly.
- **AI batch operations** (coming soon): Organize hundreds of files with a single command. Tell Cmdr to "sort these into folders by project name" and it figures out the rest.
- **Tabs**: Multiple tabs per pane with pinning, persistence, and per-tab sorting.
- **File viewer**: Built-in viewer for text files with search, syntax highlighting, and support for very large files.
- **Drive indexing**: Index your drives for fast search with an efficient integer-keyed database schema.
- **Clipboard**: Full clipboard support with Finder interop. Copy, cut, and paste files between Cmdr and Finder.
- **Delete and trash**: Trash by default, permanent delete with confirmation. Batch operations with progress and cancellation.
- **Network shares**: Connect to SMB network shares with saved credentials, mDNS discovery, and timeout protection.
- **Disk space display**: See free space per volume in the status bar and volume dropdown.
- **Custom tooltips**: Glass-effect tooltips with shortcut badges and smart positioning.
- **Accent color**: Choose between macOS system accent or Cmdr gold, with optional gold folder icons.
- **Command palette**: Quick access to every action in the app.

## Tech stack

- **Rust**: Backend logic, file operations, IPC commands, and drive indexing
- **Tauri 2**: Native desktop framework bridging Rust and the web frontend
- **Svelte 5**: Reactive frontend with TypeScript strict mode
- **Tailwind v4**: Styling with CSS-first configuration
- **SQLite**: Drive indexing with integer-keyed schema for efficient storage
- **Ed25519**: License key signing and verification

## Frequently asked questions

### What counts as "commercial use"?

If you're using Cmdr as part of your job (employment, freelancing, consulting), that's commercial use. Side projects, open source work, and personal file management are all fine without a commercial license.

### Can I use it on multiple machines?

Yes! Use Cmdr on as many machines as you like. Laptop, desktop, remote debugging rig, whatever. Your license is per user, not per machine.

### What happens after my year of updates runs out?

Nothing breaks. The last version you were entitled to keeps working, for as long as you like, on as many of your machines as you like. Updates after the first year are $39 a year, and skipping a year and coming back later is fine.

### Do I pay extra for Cmdr AI?

Not during the beta: Cmdr AI is free for everyone right now. It runs on an API key you bring from a provider you pick, or fully on-device with a local model. Later, Cmdr AI moves to a Pro plan that includes hosted models, so no API key is needed. The file manager itself stays free for personal use, and a Commercial license bought today keeps Cmdr AI with your own key or the on-device model for as long as your updates run.

### Can I see the source code?

Yes! Cmdr is source-available on GitHub at https://github.com/vdavid/cmdr. You can view, learn from, and modify the code. The license (BSL 1.1) converts to AGPL-3.0 after three years.

### What if I regret the purchase?

We offer a 30-day, no-questions-asked refund. Send an email and we'll sort it out.

### Do you offer team and enterprise licenses?

Yes. For a handful of people, buying Commercial licenses one by one is the quickest route, and each person can use theirs on all of their machines. Once your IT department has to deploy Cmdr, your security team has to sign off on it, or finance wants one invoice against a PO, that's an enterprise deal: email sales@getcmdr.com with your headcount and what you need, and you'll get a quote back.

## System requirements

- **macOS**: 12 or newer, on Apple Silicon (M1 and later) and Intel. Separate DMG installers for each architecture, plus a universal build.
- **Older macOS**: 10.15 Catalina and 11 Big Sur install and run on a best-effort basis. Everything works, but a few colors and layout details can look off, and fixes for those systems are a lower priority.
- **Linux**: Alpha support. Volumes via /proc/mounts, file ops with reflink support, trash via FreeDesktop spec, inotify file watching, native file icons via freedesktop-icons.

## License

BSL 1.1 (Business Source License). Source-available: you can view, learn from, and modify the code. The license converts to AGPL-3.0 after three years. See the GitHub repository for full license text.
