# Analytics dashboard

Private SvelteKit dashboard consolidating Cmdr business metrics, organized by acquisition stage. Deployed to Cloudflare
Pages at `analdash.getcmdr.com`, behind Cloudflare Access plus an in-app JWT gate (`src/hooks.server.ts`).

## Pages

Four routes share `routes/+layout.svelte` (sticky header: brand, page nav, range/day picker). The picker writes
`?range=` / `?day=` and is hidden on the two ledger pages (`/licenses`, `/links`).

- `/` (Acquisition, `routes/+page.svelte`): daily funnel + channels, awareness, interest, download.
- `/product` (`routes/product/`): active use, settings adoption, payment, retention, feedback & errors.
- `/licenses` (`routes/licenses/`): every license we've issued, from the api-server's `/admin/licenses`.
- `/links` (`routes/links/`): CRUD for the `?r=` short codes, proxied to the api-server admin endpoints.

Each section is a component under `src/lib/components/sections/`; shared bits in `src/lib/components/`. Data sources
live in `src/lib/server/sources/` (one module per external API); `src/lib/server/fetch-all.ts` has the per-source
loaders and the per-page composers.

## Stack

SvelteKit + `@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare`, Tailwind v4 (CSS-first in `src/app.css`, dark mode only), uPlot for charts.
All API keys stay server-side, behind `+server.ts` / `+page.server.ts`.

## Checks

`pnpm check dashboard` runs all nine (eslint, stylelint, svelte-check, import-cycles, knip, tests, build,
settings-defaults, `svelte-kit sync`). Don't judge a change by raw `pnpm lint`: the runner owns ordering.

## Must-knows

- **Auth is the app's job, not just Cloudflare's.** Access binds to a hostname, and the `pages.dev` alias reaches the
  same deployment around it, so `src/hooks.server.ts` verifies the Access JWT on every server-handled request; every
  failure path must fail closed. ❌ Never gate on the spoofable `cf-access-authenticated-user-email` header. People and
  service tokens both pass, so `locals.identity` is a `user | service` union. Why and how: `DETAILS.md` § Auth.
- **Write `{#if source.ok}` with the error state in `{:else}`, never the inverse.** Inverted, the Svelte ESLint parser
  loses the narrowing and every read off `source.data` becomes an unsafe-member-access error that looks like missing
  prop types. Flipping the branch is the fix, not an `any`. Why: `DETAILS.md`.
- **Don't import `$lib/server/*` as a runtime value into browser-bundled code** (components, route `.svelte` files);
  type-only imports are fine. It trips `vite-plugin-sveltekit-guard` at BUILD time and **`svelte-check` does NOT catch
  it**, so run `pnpm build` after touching imports across the boundary. `DETAILS.md` lists the client-shared values.
- **Every data source must go behind the 20s `withTimeout` cap in `fetch-all.ts`.** Workers `fetch` has no timeout, so
  one hung upstream otherwise stalls the whole `Promise.all` until Cloudflare's 524 at 100s. Sources run in parallel,
  return `SourceResult<T>`, and cache via `cache.ts`. Details: `DETAILS.md`.
- **The admin token (`LICENSE_SERVER_ADMIN_TOKEN`) stays server-side.** `/licenses`, `/links`, and the worker-backed
  sources resolve it in `+page.server.ts` only; the browser bundle gets only rows and a load-error string. `pnpm build`
  confirms nothing token-bearing leaks past the boundary.
- **❌ Nothing on `/licenses` may say a Paddle subscription is live.** `active` on a `paddle` row means we fulfilled
  that purchase; only `/validate` knows whether it still runs. Labels live in `$lib/licenses.ts`; the vocabulary is
  owned by `apps/api-server/src/licensing/DETAILS.md` § The licenses listing.
- **`caches.default` / `caches.open()` aren't emulated in `wrangler pages dev`.** `cache.ts` falls back to an in-memory
  Map, so don't assume the CF Cache API works locally.
- **A `null` cell renders as a dash (`–`), never a 0** in the metric tables: "couldn't get this" and "this was zero"
  differ, and every source is best-effort and independent.
- **One color means one property across the whole dashboard** (metric dots, chart strokes and fills). Keep it when
  adding UI; the palette is in `DETAILS.md`.

Local dev: `pnpm dev:dashboard` serves on port 4830, reading `.env` (copy `.env.example`; escape a literal `$` as `\$`).
Env resolution and the variables: `DETAILS.md`.

Everything else (structure, data loading, sources, auth, decisions, env vars, local QA, deployment): `DETAILS.md`.
