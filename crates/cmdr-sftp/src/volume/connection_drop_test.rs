//! A server that REALLY goes away under a live volume, and comes back.
//!
//! `reconnect_test.rs` drives the gates by dropping the session in-process
//! (`simulate_session_loss`), which proves the policy and never the wire. These
//! cells cut the actual TCP connection instead, which is what a user hits: a NAS
//! that sleeps or reboots, Wi-Fi that drops.
//!
//! ❗ The cut happens in a `cmdr_fs::testing::tcp_proxy::TcpProxy` this test owns,
//! between the client and `sftp-fixture-openssh`. ❌ Never pause or stop the
//! container: the stack is shared by lease with other test binaries, worktrees,
//! and sessions, and every one of them would see the outage too.
//!
//! Two ways down, because they end differently:
//!
//! - **Refused**: the connection closes and a redial is refused. The session's
//!   own EOF is what the next operation finds.
//! - **Silent** (a black hole): nothing closes, nothing answers. Only a timer
//!   can end a wait, so this is the cell that finds a missing deadline. It runs
//!   under a paused tokio clock so the production-length deadline elapses in
//!   virtual time.
//!
//! Every cell here needs the SFTP fixture stack: `sftp-servers/start.sh`.
