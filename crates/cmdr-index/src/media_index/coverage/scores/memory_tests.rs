//! Memory-shape guard on the resident score table.
//!
//! The table lives as long as media indexing is on, one per scored volume, and it's big:
//! 179,949 scored folders on David's boot volume held 31 MiB as path `String`s plus their
//! hash table (heap attribution, 2026-09-23), and a NAS scores 368,043. The consumers only
//! LOOK UP a folder, never enumerate paths, so the paths are dead weight once hashed.
//!
//! This pins the SHAPE (a fixed small slot per folder, nothing per folder on the heap) with
//! a bound generous enough to survive allocator and load-factor changes, and tight enough
//! that storing the path again blows straight through it. The search weight map carries
//! the same guard (`apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/search/ranking/memory_tests.rs`).
