//! Holding a folder exclusion at READ time.
//!
//! Excluding a folder vetoes its enrichment and purges its stored rows, but a read can't
//! lean on either: the purge can fail to land (`scheduler/purge.rs` keeps retrying it), a
//! folder excluded while its NAS was offline is only purged on reconnect, and a row can
//! commit in the moment between the veto and the delete. So every read that can return an
//! image's path, text, tag, score, or facts asks [`ReadExclusion::hides`] first. Ask Cmdr's
//! `search_photos` and `image_facts` tools read through `MediaIndex` too, which is what
//! keeps an excluded folder's OCR text away from a cloud model.
//!
//! The predicate is the veto's own ([`NetworkEnrichConfig::is_excluded`] over the OS path,
//! which folds names the way the platform's filesystem does), so reading and indexing can't
//! disagree about what's excluded. Exclusions are OS-path keyed while a network volume stores
//! index-relative paths, so a read places the volume's rows at EVERY root it's known by: the
//! live mount root while it's mounted, plus each root a pass recorded in `media.db`. That
//! keeps an unmounted NAS's excluded folders hidden, and keeps a folder excluded under a
//! share's old mount name hidden after the share remounts under a new one. A volume with no
//! known root can't place its rows, so while any folder is excluded it shows nothing, until
//! its next pass records the root.
