//! Event reconciler: buffers FSEvents during scan, replays after scan completes.
//!
//! During the initial full scan, the watcher runs concurrently and buffers events.
//! Once the scan finishes, the reconciler replays only events that arrived *after*
//! the scanner read their affected path (using monotonically increasing event IDs).
//! Events with `event_id <= scan_start_event_id` are discarded because the scan data
//! is newer.
//!
//! After replay, the reconciler switches to live mode where events are processed
//! immediately.
//!
//! ## Integer-keyed resolution (milestone 4)
//!
//! All path resolution uses `store::resolve_path(conn, path)` to convert filesystem
//! paths to integer entry IDs. Write messages use integer-keyed variants:
//! `UpsertEntryV2`, `DeleteEntryById`, `DeleteSubtreeById`, `PropagateDeltaById`.
//! The reconciler holds a read connection (`rusqlite::Connection`) for path resolution.
//!
//! ## What lives where
//!
//! This file holds [`EventReconciler`] — the buffer, the live/replay switch, and the
//! state a rescan drain rides on. The work itself is split by responsibility:
//! [`dir_read`] reads one directory off disk, [`diff`] compares it against the DB,
//! [`subtree`] walks a subtree through those two, [`events`] turns one FSEvent into
//! writes, and [`finish`] ends a full-rescan walk.
