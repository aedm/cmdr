//! What a scan parked on a real drive does, pinned on a real HFS+ disk image (macOS):
//! what the index does TODAY when the drive vanishes mid-scan, and that a parked
//! walker worker still holds the drive once its manager is gone.
//!
//! A real `IndexManager` scans a tree on the image, the way `event_stream_tests.rs`
//! drives one over a temp dir. The walker's test-only park point
//! (`scanner/walker/park.rs`) holds the walk between directories after a few reads,
//! with no directory handle open on the image. The pin force-detaches the image there
//! and lets the walk go on, so the drive vanishes BETWEEN reads, never under an open
//! fd; the control releases the same park without detaching, so the pin's outcome is
//! the vanish's doing and not the park's.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d: they attach real disk images. Hand-run with
//! `cargo nextest run -p cmdr-index --run-ignored only -E 'test(indexing::tests::vanish_tests::)'`.
//! Serialized in the `disk-image` nextest group, and machine-wide by the harness's
//! session lock. HFS+ only: the kernel `hfs` driver takes a forced detach under a live
//! FSEvents stream, where FSKit `msdos` is the kernel-panic surface.
