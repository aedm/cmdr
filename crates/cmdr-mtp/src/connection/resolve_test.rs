//! Path → handle resolution when the path cache doesn't know the path.
//!
//! The cache only knows what some listing put there, and a path reaches an op by
//! many routes that never listed its parent: a pane restored after a reconnect, a
//! search result, a go-to-path, or a pane still showing a file another op already
//! removed. Every one of those used to fail as an untyped "path not in cache", so
//! the user read a generic failure instead of either a working copy or a clear
//! "already moved or deleted".
//!
//! Two halves, both pinned here: a miss re-lists the parent chain and carries on,
//! and a path the device really doesn't hold answers the TYPED
//! `MtpConnectionError::ObjectNotFound` carrying the path that was asked for.
