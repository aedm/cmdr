//! What an `MtpVolume` answers once its phone's session is gone.
//!
//! A volume outlives its session in whoever still holds it: a conflict check, a
//! copy, a pane re-read that started before the cable came out. Every one of
//! those used to hear `VolumeError::NotFound`, because the session layer's
//! `NotConnected` mapped there, and "not found" is an ANSWER to those callers.
//! The conflict scan reads it as "the destination doesn't exist yet, so nothing
//! clashes" and the paste went ahead with no conflict prompt.
