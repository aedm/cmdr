/// How smb2's reading maps onto the watchdog's three-valued answer.
///
/// - `Unresponsive` is `Dead`: the keepalive is armed, a request is out, and the
///   server has put NOTHING on the wire past the liveness window, probe replies
///   included. It's the reading `Error::ServerUnresponsive` rests on, read before
///   any request has paid for it. A slow response can't produce it (every byte
///   counts as it lands), but a NAS saturated enough to drop ECHOs for a whole
///   window can, which is why it's only half of the watchdog's gate.
/// - `Alive` is `Alive`: a byte arrived inside the window, mid-frame included.
/// - `Idle` and `Quiet` are `None`. Idle has nothing outstanding to be silent
///   about, and Quiet is silence that proves nothing yet (too short, or no
///   keepalive to tell slow from dead).
/// - `Disconnected` is `None`, deliberately. A torn-down connection has already
///   failed every request on it, so the task the watchdog would unstick has its
///   error in hand, and the per-file retry takes it from there. `Dead` would
///   arrive strictly after that error and add nothing.
///
/// ❌ Don't read this verdict alone: the watchdog ANDs it with its own stillness
/// window (`transfer_probe.rs`), because `Unresponsive` flips back to `Alive` the
/// moment a byte lands.
