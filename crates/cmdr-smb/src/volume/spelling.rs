//! Finding the server's own spelling of a path that didn't come from the server.
//!
//! An SMB name is opaque bytes the server matches exactly, so a path typed by
//! the user, restored from a saved tab, or carried over from the macOS kernel
//! mount (which decomposes every name) misses whenever it spells an accented or
//! differently cased component another way than the server stores it. No single
//! normalization of the whole path fixes that: one directory can hold its own
//! name composed and its children's decomposed. So the fix is per COMPONENT,
//! against a real listing: find the first component that doesn't open, list its
//! parent, match under Unicode-form-and-case folding, take the server's bytes,
//! and carry on down. `DETAILS.md` § "SMB names are opaque bytes".
//!
//! Reached only through [`Volume::find_stored_spelling`](cmdr_fs::volume::Volume::find_stored_spelling),
//! at the seams where a foreign path enters. ❌ Never from inside an operation:
//! every other call on this backend means the exact bytes it's handed.
