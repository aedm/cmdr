//! Synthetic APFS and HFS+ disk images for tests that need a real removable volume
//! (macOS only).
//!
//! ❌ **Never a physical disk, and never a new FAT, exFAT, or MS-DOS image.** A
//! `diskutil unmount` of a physical FAT32 card wedged macOS 26's FSKit `msdos`
//! service and kernel-panicked a Mac (`crates/cmdr-index/src/indexing/tests/CLAUDE.md`).
//! The two legacy FAT variants exist only for the hand-run `external_drive_fixture`.
//!
//! What the harness guarantees, in code:
//!
//! - **One test at a time, machine-wide.** [`DiskImageSession::acquire`] takes an
//!   exclusive `flock` on `$TMPDIR/cmdr-disk-image-tests.lock`, held until the last
//!   handle drops. Every image needs a session, so no test can forget the lock, and
//!   two worktrees running the lane can't unmount under each other.
//! - **Every `hdiutil`, `diskutil`, and `umount` call goes through the runner**, a
//!   closed list of verbs, each SIGKILLed past [`runner::TOOL_DEADLINE`].
//! - **Before every call that changes a disk, the target is proven ours**: `diskutil`
//!   resolves it to its physical whole disk and `hdiutil info` must list both under
//!   this image's backing file. DiskArbitration reuses a freed BSD unit at once, so
//!   a stored node is never trusted. `detach -force` also refuses nested and outer
//!   images.
//! - **Unique volume names** (`CMDR<pid><n>`), `-nobrowse` everywhere, and a
//!   [`DiskImage`] detaches and deletes itself on drop, unwind included.
//! - **Leftovers are reclaimed at [`DiskImageSession::acquire`]**, because a drop can't
//!   run when the test process is SIGKILLed. See `reclaim_orphans` for why that's safe
//!   only there.
