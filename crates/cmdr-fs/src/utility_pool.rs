//! A keep-alive pool of dedicated `Utility`-QoS threads, for background work that
//! would otherwise spawn a fresh OS thread per job.
//!
//! ## Why it exists
//!
//! The index walker ran every walk on threads of its own and the rescan drain ran
//! every subtree reconcile on one: ~29,000 thread creations in 40 minutes on a busy
//! machine. Each costs a `clone` plus stack setup, and under mimalloc each exiting
//! thread abandons its heap pages, which the allocator comparison tied to the idle
//! slack (`docs/notes/performance/walker-thread-pool-2026-09-27.md`). A pool turns
//! that stream into a handful of long-lived threads.
//!
//! ## What it promises
//!
//! - **A job never queues behind another job.** [`UtilityPool::execute`] hands the
//!   job to an idle thread, or spawns one. The pool is unbounded on purpose: its
//!   callers bound their own concurrency (a walk's `num_threads`, the drain's
//!   single flight), and a job that parks for a whole walk must not keep another
//!   walk's worker from starting.
//! - **An idle thread exits after `keep_alive`**, so a quiet app holds no threads
//!   for work it isn't doing. The most recently idled thread is reused first, which
//!   lets the rest age out when demand drops.
//! - **Every thread is `Utility` for its whole life.** That's what makes pooling
//!   compatible with `thread_qos`'s rule against lowering a shared thread: the
//!   lowered class can't leak onto unrelated work, because every job a pool runs
//!   asked for it.
//! - **Nothing leaks from one job to the next** except thread-locals. The job is
//!   dropped (with everything it captured) before the thread goes idle, so a pooled
//!   thread holds no `Arc` a job gave it.
//!
//! A job that panics unwinds its thread only, as a dedicated thread would.
//!
//! ## How a job reaches a thread
//!
//! Each idle thread parks on its own [`Handoff`] and is listed in `idle`. `execute`
//! pops one and writes the job into its slot while still holding the `idle` lock,
//! so a thread that finds itself no longer listed knows its job is already there.
//! That's what makes the race between a keep-alive timeout and a hand-off safe
//! without a second counter.
