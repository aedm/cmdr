//! The one key two names share when they differ only in Unicode form or case.
//!
//! NFC, then lowercase. macOS holds `é` composed and decomposed side by side,
//! the kernel's SMB mount decomposes every name it lists, and an SMB server
//! matches a name's exact bytes, so "is this the same name?" needs one answer
//! everywhere Cmdr asks it: a share's identity (`volume::ids::smb_volume_id`), a
//! transfer's destination buckets, the SMB spelling resolve, and a pane landing
//! its cursor on a name spelled another way.
//!
//! ❌ A comparison key only, never sent to a volume: the server stores the bytes
//! it was given, and one directory can hold both forms.
//!
//! Two narrower answers ride beside it: [`differ_only_in_form`], the pair a
//! write guard treats as ONE name (a person can't tell them apart; case they
//! can), and [`composed`], the spelling a NEW name takes on a volume that asks.
